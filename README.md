# iPad Weather App

###### Live: https://justinkim2015.github.io/ipad-weather-app/#/

## Description

This is a single-page weather application made with ReactJS and vanilla CSS.  By leveraging the data of a Geolocation API and a weather API this app shows you real-time data of the weather in your area.    

I made this app as a capstone of a course to learn and practice ReactJS.  The biggest hurdle I dealt with while making this application were how to properly deal with async functions and API calls so that undefined values don't break my code.

By breaking things into components as much as possible I could really understand how using React can massively increase the speed and scalability of front-end development.
